## Introduction

This service will listen to Kafka for a notification of a change made in Smartlogic, verify whether the change concerns concordance, convert the JSON-LD in the message to a normalised UPP view of a concordance and finally send the JSON to the concordance-rw-dynamo.

## Installation

Download the source code, dependencies and test dependencies:

        go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor
        go get -u github.com/Financial-Times/smartlogic-concordance-transformer
        cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Financial-Times/smartlogic-concordance-transformer
        govendor sync
        go build .

## Running locally

1. Run the tests and install the binary:

        govendor sync
        govendor test -v -race
        go install

2. Run the binary (using the `help` flag to see the available optional arguments):

        $GOPATH/bin/smartlogic-concordance-transformer [--help]

## Service endpoints
See the api/api.yml for the swagger definitions of the endpoints

### POST /transform
This endpoint is for testing and help ongoing support. This endpoint only transforms the JSON-LD payload and returns the UPP source representation but doesnâ€™t send it on down the pipeline to the concordance-rw-s3

Using curl:

    curl -X POST -i https://user:pass@pub-prod-up.ft.com/__smartlogic-concordance-transformer/transform/send --d @payload.txt --header "Content-Type:application/json"

The expected response will give us a UPP source system representation of this smart logic concordance

e.g
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    X-Request-Id: transaction ID, e.g. tid_etmIWTJVeA
    {
      "uuid": "2d3e16e0-61cb-4322-8aff-3b01c59f4daa",
      "concordedIds": [
    	"70f4732b-7f7d-30a1-9c29-0cceec23760e"
      ]
    }

## Healthchecks
Admin endpoints are:

`/__gtg`

`/__health`

`/__build-info`

`/__ping`

There are several checks performed:

* Checks that a connection can be made to the concordances-rw-s3 service

### Logging

* The application uses [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus); the log file is initialised in [main.go](main.go).
* Logging requires an `env` app parameter, for all environments other than `local` logs are written to file.
* When running locally, logs are written to console. If you want to log locally to file, you need to pass in an env parameter that is != `local`.
* NOTE: `/__build-info` and `/__gtg` endpoints are not logged as they are called every second from varnish/vulcand and this information is not needed in logs/splunk.
